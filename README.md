# Coordinate-Mapper
This is a script to map the point (node/anchor) points of polygons created in InkScape to be used for custom filled maps in Tableau. 

## How it Works
The script parses an .svg file created in InkScape and calculates the absolute x,y coordinates of each point in each polygon. It then writes the coordinate information to a comma delimited .csv file ready to use with Tableau.

## Why?
Mapping the point coordinates for custom filled shapes by hand was boring and took forever. 

## Installation
First uninstall any previous version of Coordinate Mapper either from the Start menu or from Settings/Control Panel.
Download the .zip for the latest version of Coordinate Mapper from https://github.com/AFulkerson/Coordinate-Mapper/releases.
